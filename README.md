Environmental Pollution & Chronic Health Conditions: Uncovering the Connection



  

### Overview

Our project focuses on analyzing the correlation between environmental factors and chronic diseases in different cities and areas. We are using datasets such as the 500 Cities data, chronic conditions spending data, healthcare spending data, superfund data, and air quality data to assess the environmental impact on these locations.

By examining the relationship between environmental pollution and the prevalence of chronic diseases, our goal is to identify areas with higher environmental risks and potential health implications. This analysis will provide insights into the connection between environmental conditions and chronic diseases, helping us understand the impact on population health.

  

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to understand the correlation between environmental factors and chronic diseases in different cities and areas.

 - We are trying to see a correlation between Environmental Factors and chronic diseases.
 - We can gain insights into the potential health implications of living in areas with higher environmental risks.
 - Do communities affected by multiple environmental stressors
   experience a higher rate of chronic diseases?

  

### Data

The datasets we are utilizing are as follows:-

 - **500 Cities Data**
 - **Chronic Conditions Spending Data**
 - **Mediclaim and Medicare spending data**
 - **Superfund Sites Data**
 - **Air Quality Data**


### Database Design
We are organising processed datasets into our database  - **toxic_site_hazards_db**
The data in this database is stored under 6 tables .We are working to normalize the data  as much as we can during the data cleaning phase.

  

  

### Methods
We utilized the below mentioned methods for data cleaning and preprocessing :


1. Python

2. Pandas

3. Numpy
For each dataset ,we had a specific approach to the based on dataset's  requirements. These approaches involved steps such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing data formats, and resolving inconsistencies. The links below provide information on each dataset cleaning approach.

### Results

  We are still at a early stage of our project .We need to work on our data to be share our analysis.

  

### Future Work

  For the next week, we are planning to work on our Machine Learning model -Description of preliminary data  
preprocessing  
- Description of preliminary feature  
engineering and preliminary feature  
selection, including their decision-making  
process  
- Description of how data was split into  
training and testing sets  
-Explanation of model choice, including  
limitations and benefits
